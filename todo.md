- modify post UI
- set up expo build for proper development builds to test native constructs
- sketch pages and consider flows

- error handling for failed fetch? Make a pattern for this? Use a library?
- set email field to be private (or just remove from BE, use auth as source of truth)

- tests for storage rules

ideas:
- maybe have a little breakdown of ~3-5 most active intentions on someone's profile
